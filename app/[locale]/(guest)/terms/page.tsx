            <p>The maximum liability of Triplovia in any circumstance shall be limited to the total booking amount paid by the User for the specific booking in dispute.</p>

            <h2>4. Hotel Bookings</h2>
            <p>Triplovia acts only as a facilitator providing an online platform for Users to search and book accommodation services offered by independent hotels, homestays, resorts, guesthouses and similar properties (collectively referred to as &quot;Properties&quot;).</p>
            <p>All information displayed on the Platform including property descriptions, images, amenities, facilities, policies, pricing and availability is provided by the respective Properties. Triplovia does not independently verify such information.</p>

            <h3>4.1. User Responsibilities for Hotel Bookings</h3>
            <p>The User must carry valid government identification at check-in, follow property rules and policies, maintain proper conduct during stay, and pay for damages caused to property.</p>
            <p>The Property reserves the right to deny check-in if valid ID is not provided, User fails to meet age requirements, property policies are violated, local ID restrictions apply, unmarried couple policies apply, or maximum occupancy limits are exceeded.</p>

            <h3>4.2. Hotel Policies and Check-in Terms</h3>
            <p>Check-in and check-out times shall be as defined by the Property. Early check-in and late check-out are subject to availability and may involve additional charges payable directly to the Property.</p>

            <h3>4.3. Child Policy and Occupancy Rules</h3>
            <p>Child accommodation policies are determined by individual Properties. For pricing and occupancy purposes, the following general classification may apply unless otherwise specified:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>0-5 years: Infant</li>
              <li>6-11 years: Child</li>
              <li>12 years and above: Adult</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.4. Additional Charges by the Property</h3>
            <p>The booking amount paid through Triplovia covers only the services confirmed during booking. Additional charges including extra meals, room service, laundry, telephone usage, mini bar usage, parking, security deposits, extra bed charges, and festival surcharges shall be payable directly to the Property unless specifically included in the booking.</p>

            <h3>4.5. Payment Terms for Hotel Bookings</h3>
            <p>Hotel bookings may be classified as prepaid bookings, pay at property bookings, or part payment bookings (where applicable). Service fees charged by Triplovia are non-refundable unless explicitly stated.</p>

            <h3>4.6. No Show and Cancellation</h3>
            <p>If the User fails to check-in on the booking date (&quot;No Show&quot;), the booking is treated as a within-window cancellation and no refund shall be applicable. All hotel bookings carry a 48-hour free cancellation window. Cancellations made 48 hours or more before check-in are eligible for a refund minus the Razorpay payment gateway fee (approximately 2.36% of the booking amount). Cancellations made within 48 hours of check-in are non-refundable. For full details, see our <a href="/refund-policy" className="text-primary hover:text-gold">Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2>5. Cab Bookings</h2>
            <p>Triplovia provides an online platform enabling Users to book cab services offered by independent cab operators (&quot;Cab Operators&quot;). Triplovia does not own, operate or control any cab services and shall not be considered a transport provider.</p>
            <p>The contract of transportation service exists solely between the User and the Cab Operator. Triplovia&apos;s role is limited to facilitating the booking and providing booking confirmation.</p>

            <h2>6. Bike Rental Terms</h2>
            <p>Triplovia provides an online platform that enables Users to book bike rental services offered by independent rental providers (&quot;Rental Partners&quot;). The rental agreement exists solely between the User and the Rental Partner.</p>
            <p>Users must be at least 18 years of age, possess a valid driving license, carry original license during pickup, and provide identification proof if required.</p>

            <h2>7. Backwater Boating Terms</h2>
            <p>Triplovia provides an online platform enabling Users to discover and book boating and water activity experiences operated by independent activity providers (&quot;Boat Operators&quot;).</p>
            <p>The User understands that boating and water activities involve inherent risks including slipping hazards, water accidents, drowning risks, weather risks, and equipment failures. By booking a boating activity, the User voluntarily accepts these risks.</p>
            <p>Users must follow all safety instructions provided by the Boat Operator including wearing safety equipment, not engaging in unsafe behavior, and following capacity limits.</p>
            <p>Each boat trip type carries its own free cancellation window displayed at the time of booking. Cancellations made before this deadline are eligible for a refund minus the gateway fee deduction. Cancellations made within the restricted window, after the trip date, or no-shows are non-refundable. Weather-based rescheduling is at the Boat Operator&apos;s discretion and does not entitle the User to a cash refund.</p>

            <h2>8. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>Bookings made through Triplovia may follow one of the following payment models: prepaid booking (full payment at time of booking), partial payment (advance with balance payable to service provider), or pay at service provider.</p>
            <p>The total booking price may include base service price, government taxes, Triplovia service fee, add-on services, applicable GST, and convenience charges where applicable.</p>
            <p>All payments shall be processed in Indian Rupees (INR) through Razorpay, a third-party payment gateway. Triplovia currently provides services only within India.</p>

            <h3>8.1. Payment Gateway Fee on Cancellations</h3>
            <p>Razorpay levies a transaction processing fee at the time of payment capture. This fee is not reversed by Razorpay when a refund is issued. Accordingly, all eligible refunds shall be subject to a deduction of approximately 2.36% of the booking amount (comprising 2% Razorpay transaction fee plus 18% GST on that fee). This deduction applies regardless of how early the cancellation is made. For detailed examples and timelines, see our <a href="/refund-policy" className="text-primary hover:text-gold">Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy</a>.</p>

            <h3>8.2. Refund Process</h3>
            <p>All customer-initiated cancellation refunds go through an internal admin review process before being submitted to the payment gateway. Approved refunds are credited to the User&apos;s original payment method within 5–10 business days depending on the payment method, subject to Razorpay and bank processing times.</p>
